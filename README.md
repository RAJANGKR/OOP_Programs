# OOP C++ Practice Assignments

## 📘 Introduction
This repository contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignments and practice questions written in C++. These questions were given as part of my engineering coursework and are aimed at helping me strengthen core OOP concepts through practical coding.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and Destructors
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical)
- Polymorphism (Compile-time and Run-time)
- Function Overloading
- Operator Overloading
- File Handling
- Friend Functions
- Static Members
- and etc............

## 🧠 Assignment Questions
Each file in this repository corresponds to one practice question. The filename or code comments describe the problem statement. Some example topics include:


> 📝 *Note: Actual questions are included as comments inside each `.cpp` file.*

## 💻 How to Run
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`)
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
4. Run the output:
   ```bash
   ./output   # On Windows, use: output.exe
   ```
